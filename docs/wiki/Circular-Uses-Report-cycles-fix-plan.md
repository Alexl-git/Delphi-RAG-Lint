# Circular Uses Report (cycles + fix plan)

Finds `uses` cycles among indexed units and, on request, proposes a followable
refactoring plan to break them. Reach for it when the compiler is fighting
circular references, or a project's dependency graph feels tangled.

## Running it from the CLI
```
drag-lint cycles --db <file.sqlite> [--edges] [--causes] [--plan] [--format json|text]
```
`--edges` and `--causes` add detail to the cycle report; `--plan` produces the
refactoring playbook; `--format` selects `json` or `text` output.

## What `--plan` gives you
A mechanical procedure, written so that a reader with no project context can
follow it literally:

* **What moves where** -- each symbol that ties the cycle together, with its kind
  and the recipe for that kind. Enums, records, constants and variables move
  unchanged into a new leaf unit `<Declaring>.Contracts` (exact line ranges, doc
  comment included). A class whose method bodies use the cycle is not moved: a
  base class with just the members its consumers use is extracted instead, and
  the playbook says why. Every consuming unit is listed with its section and
  first-use line.
* **Uses decisions** -- per unit: keep the old partner, move it from the
  interface to the implementation uses, or remove it.
* **The new units' full text**, and the rule for their uses clause.
* **Every edit** (units, `.dpr`, `.dproj`) as current text + new text, bottom-up.
* **DONE** and a **checklist** ending in the re-index command and the exact
  output `cycles` must print afterwards, plus what to do for each compile error.

An interface-coupled cycle becomes a legal implementation-only one (Part A). The
optional Part B names the edge that can be cut next; re-running `--plan` after
Part A prints it as the same kind of steps. When no edge can be cut mechanically
(it carries a routine, or a class whose bodies use the cycle), the playbook says
so and gives the standard remedy instead of guessing.

## Reaching it in the IDE
drag-lint > Uses & Dependencies > Circular Uses Report (cycles + fix plan)...

## What it needs
Required. You must have indexed the project before running this -- cycle
detection reads unit-to-unit `uses` edges from the index, not from disk.

## Example
Illustrative only, against a project database that has already been indexed:
```
drag-lint cycles --db C:\Projects\MyApp\_D-RAG\MyApp.sqlite --plan --format text
```
This would report any `uses` cycles involving, say, the unit that declares
`TfrmMain`, plus a suggested order of moves to break them.
