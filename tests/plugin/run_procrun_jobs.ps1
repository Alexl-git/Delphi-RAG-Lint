  run_procrun_jobs.ps1 -- build and run ProcRunJobsTests.dpr (wave 2 / 1.31.6 lane C).

  WHAT IT COVERS. After B-19 three exits from a plugin child run still did not
  bound the run or kill its tree: KillProcess terminated the direct child only
  (a cmd.exe wrapper's grandchild kept the pipe open), RunCaptureStreaming had
  no deadline, and TDragLintJobQueue.Destroy waited out a running child. The
  dpr drives a cmd /c ping >nul tree through each exit and asserts the call is
  bounded and the grandchild is gone; positive controls (an already-exited
  child, a streaming run's lines and exit code, the queue really running the
  job) keep the negative assertions from passing against a no-op.

  RED BASELINE: see the commit message of the guard commit.

  Same build recipe as run_procrun_timeout.ps1; spawns only its own children,
  touches no database -- not dl:serial. Reads the engine-hold sentinel (case 6
  fails its precondition rather than passing vacuously while a hold is live).

  Usage: pwsh -File tests\plugin\run_procrun_jobs.ps1
